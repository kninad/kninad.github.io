# Notes

A miscellaneous collection of notes. I am not a blogger yet but I hope to post some interesting things here. Of course, interest is very subjective and someone who is already a wise person, programmer, researcher might find such notes trivial! I usually write about stuff that I want to document for myself. It may
include some useful bits of information that may help me later.
