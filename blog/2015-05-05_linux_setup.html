<h1 id="linux-setup">Linux Setup</h1>
<p>Date: 2015-05-05</p>
<h2 id="back-story">Back story</h2>
<p>My first Linux based os was Ubuntu 10.04 lts which I installed on my home computer using wubi (it basically made ubuntu an ‘installed program’ on windows). But this was just an exploration phase after I had come to know about Linux and the GNU project. In first semester in undergrad at iitk I used the computer center labs (CentOS, gnome 2) and also we had to write C programming assignments on those computers.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In my second semester, I became more sucked into all the different DEs! After that semester I became so comfortable and used to the way of things in a linux os that I installed ubuntu on my personal laptop (dual boot) and as soon my Windows os crashed right before an end semester exam, I decided to use linux almost exclusively and henceforth only booted into windows for games (fifa/cs).</p>
<p>I think once a person gets used to the environment a linux based os , it can be easily used for everyday computing tasks and I have even managed to convince my father to make the switch (ofcourse after he longer had use for ms-office)! This is especially in today’s web centric world where we use our browser most of the time.</p>
<p>Another motivation was the availability of programming tools which were present by default in any installation along with the shell. I still use the standard ‘noob’ distro i.e ubuntu (with Mate desktop environment) as it suits my needs perfectly! Some mental notes put down:</p>
<h2 id="useful-non-default-programs">Useful non-default programs</h2>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>LaTeX editor: Texmaker</li>
<li>Calibre: ebook management</li>
<li>Numix theme/icons for making desktop ‘pretty’</li>
<li>Tmux: terminal tabbing/windows</li>
<li>Redshift: reduce blue intensity of screen light (during dark hours)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to keep in mind</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Days of distro-hopping (same goes for DE) are over. Go with what works best and makes you productive.</li>
<li>Preferably download os .iso file over torrent and remember to check hashes.</li>
<li>Use the file backup utilities to prevent catastrophe!!!</li>
<li>Suspend issue: install nvidia driver with <code>acpi_sleep=nonvs</code> in grub + kernel update</li>
<li>Screen tearing: again drive + compositor like compiz helps</li>
<li>Battery Life: Install TLP / switch off nvidia gpu</li>
<li>Debian not added as sudo: You have to login as root and add your user as sudo. <code>#adduser username sudo</code></li>
<li>Fonts: In Debian 8, fonts did not look ‘pretty’ by default. <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts">Fonts wiki</a> will help. Also check anti-aliasing settings, font rendering.</li>
