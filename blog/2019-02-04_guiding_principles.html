  <h1 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h1>
  <p>Date: 2019-02-04</p>
  <p>I wrote down some key principles to summarize many discussions with
  friends and family over life, spirituality and related topics. Most
  approaches towards ‚Äúlife‚Äù are not exactly taught and we need to
  explore and see what works for us from the vast religious, spiritual
  and philosophical literature available to us. Also trying (action)
  these bullet points is more important than just contemplating about
  different approaches!</p>
  <ul class="incremental">
  <li><p>Energy maximization: Sleep better and waste less energy. Good
  sleep should be number one priority, since without it our mental
  health suffers. What works for me is saying a small prayer which my
  ‚Äúaaji‚Äù (grandmother) taught me along with just being grateful. Taking
  some time out for meditation and exercise have definitely helped
  me!</p></li>
  <li><p>Maintaining a positive outlook: We can‚Äôt be absolutely sure of
  everything in life, so why not take a positive perspective whenever in
  doubt! I have learnt that our thought process needs active training in
  this regard and just our ‚Äúnazariya‚Äù (perspective) can make a big
  difference to our mood, leading to a more joyful time.</p></li>
  <li><p>Enjoy moments in life: Strive to live in the present and not
  take unnecessary worry about things out of our hand. What works for me
  is finishing my obligations (without procrastination) by viewing
  myself from a 3rd person view i.e someone who I am responsible for!
  Also not having too many unrealistic expectations in general leads to
  much less sorrow.</p></li>
  <li><p>I have had a blessed life until now and it is up to me to
  augment it further. We don‚Äôt know what might happen tomorrow, so enjoy
  while the journey lasts!</p></li>
