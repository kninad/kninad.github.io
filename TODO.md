# TODO

Purpose: Review websites and plan what content to add (general structure of 
the website). Fun / weird stuff can always go under Misc!

Edit MENU to change structure and link to pages directly by providing a links under 
subheadings. But collecting links on a separate page looks like a better idea.

Links in jemdoc consider the relative path, so non-essential stuff can be put in 
separate folders. Later on can manage add notes in a subdir and modify the shell script to
go in each subdir -> check for .jemdoc.txt files -> convert to equivalent .html files. This
will make the website folder cleaner (but remember then to modify appropriate links!). Will be
useful once content on the website starts piling up!


## Home
- Research interests: Short summary and advisor info.
- Teaching (TAed courses + mentees)
- Reviewing
- Talks
- Publications and Preprints (Can later move this to a separate page + add link to google
  scholar or related websites)
- Software: link to github repos of important codes? + short description (can be in misc too)


## Research

An entire page dedicated to short summaries of papers and high-level ideas about your researach.
Also acts as a way to organize your papers! Need not include all your pubs. Add relevant images and pdf links to papers. Also can add a wordcloud image at the beginning or end. 


## Misc

- Add stuff about hobbies: music, sketching, football (notes for them) + other thoughts under
  an appropriate section header
  
- Add technical notes under a different subsection. Make sure to add dates to all notes. Can be 
  about some good concepts / demos (encountered while surfing, homeworks etc)

- Can use the MENU file to link notes directly! (see jemdoc homepage)

- Finally, there will be a Useful Links + Footy pic section in Misc

- Can add undergrad and other side projects too!
