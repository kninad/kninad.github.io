% Gre guide

This is a short guide for the GRE exam. I plan to list down some important 
resources that I found helpful.

**Approximate timeline for preparation: < 2 months**

1. Start with the free sample exam from ETS website. This will help in knowing 
where we stand and the areas to focus on and it will also give an approximate 
score range to work on.

2. A physical book (eg: ETS book/Kaplan/Manhattan etc) will help in revising the
basics of math (if you have been away from it for a long time!). They usually
also include some sample essays and detailed explanations for solutions
(helpful for the Verbal section questions).

3. A good alternative to the book is the free website of
[Greenlight test prep](https://www.greenlighttestprep.com/) which has very good
guides for the three sections/ The site also videos, in short its a complete 
package!

4. For testing your preparation in addition to the the two free tests from
ETS software, one can give numerous free tests by registering on the websites of
the major companies who produce GRE test preparation material (kaplan etc.)

5. I also found the app by Magoosh very useful for the recalling the various new 
words in the verbal section. In the app I could only progress upto the six 
common word lists but nevertheless it made a major impact on improving my score.

I would also like to note that majority of my friends found this whole experience
of gre exam and the subsequent sending of scores to be very alike to a scam.
The price of sending additonal scores is very high especially for students in 
developing countries (where majority of ets customers come from). 

Also the fee for 
giving the exam already burns a hole in the pocket and then therefore sending 
the extra scores electronically should not be so high (atleast the upper limit
for colleges to send scores should be around 8-10).
