% Gre 

This is a short guide for the GRE exam. I plan to list down some important 
resources that I found helpful. My approximate timeline for preparation was
~ 1 month.

1. Start with the free sample exam software from ets website. This will help in knowing 
the areas to focus on and it will also give an approximate score range to work on.

2. A physical book { or ebook/pdf if you know how to obtain them ;) }  like 
ets book/kaplan/manhattan etc will help in revising the
basics of math (if you have been away from math for a long time!). It usually 
includes sample essays and detailed explanations and solutions for practice problems
(helpful for the verbal section questions).

3. A good alternative to the book is the free website of
[Greenlight test prep](https://www.greenlighttestprep.com/) which has video and 
text guides for all the three sections. Its free section is sufficient for
preparation and is definitely a complete package!

4. For practice tests in addition to the the two free ones from the
ets software, there are numerous free tests available online which can be 
accessed by registering on the websites of the major agencies who produce gre 
test preparation material (kaplan etc.)

5. I also found the vocab builder app by magoosh very useful for the recalling the new 
words in the verbal section. In the app I could only progress upto the six 
common word lists but nevertheless it made a major impact on my verbal score.

I would also like to note that majority of my friends found this whole experience
of gre exam and the subsequent sending of scores to be very similar to a scam due 
to its high (and probably unjustified) fee for additional services.

The fee for giving the exam already burns a hole in the pocket for students from
developing countries and therefore the fee 
for sending 
the extra scores (electronically!!) should not be so high or atleast the upper limit
for number of colleges to send scores should be raised to 8-10.
