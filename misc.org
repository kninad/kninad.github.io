* Football

For quite some time, my primary passtime has been playing and watching 
football. Here are some football related websites that I like:

- [[http://fantasy.premierleague.com/][Fantasy premier league]]
- [[https://www.tifofootball.com/][Tifo Football]]
- [[http://spielverlagerung.com/][Spielverlagerung]]

The photo on the right is with my football friends at iitk footy ground around the 
time we won the Institute football league! The other photo is from a memorable
trip to Aksi beach near Mumbai.

* Guiding philosophy

1. Energy maximization: Minimize energy loss by wasting time on useless things. Take a nice nap instead :)
2. Maintaining positive outlook:  We can't be absolutely sure of everything in life,  so why not take a positive perspective whenever in doubt!
3. Enjoy moments in life: Strive to live in the present and not take unnecessary worry about things out of our hand.
