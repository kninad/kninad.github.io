I usually write about stuff that I want to document for myself. It may
include some useful bits of information that may help me later. 
Most of the stuff posted here was scattered around my computer and hence
I decided to write these posts to consolidate it.
Another (rather weak) motivation was that since I have a website,
why not put up some useful stuff on it!
