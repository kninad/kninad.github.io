My main research focus is on robot manipulation methods, especially robust grasping. I am interested in developing generalizable grasp and manipulation methods which can scale well to unseen objects and gripper morphologies. I am currently trying to develop generative models for fast and accurate grasp synthesis. In addition to this, I am also interested in interactive perception based methods relating to real world unseen object segmentation.
