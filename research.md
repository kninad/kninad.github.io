# Research

My current focus is on designing novel deep learning algorithms for scene understanding and then using that for efficient grasping (as a downstream task). The input modality can be point clouds, rgb(-d) images and I try to use other sources of signals like object-contact manifolds to guide the learning process. As a consequence of my effort towards making algorithms for real world settings, I am also interested in topics like equi(or inv)-variant networks, deformable object modeling, deep generative models and robust benchmarking for robot manipulation.
