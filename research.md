# Research

My main research focus is on robot manipulation methods, especially robust grasping. I am interested in developing generalizable grasp and manipulation methods which can scale well to unseen objects and gripper morphologies. I am currently trying to develop generative models for fast and accurate grasp synthesis. In addition to this, I am also interested in interactive perception based methods for real world robotics and have a couple of projects relating to real world segmentation. Apart from these, I am excited to learn more about topics like equivariant networks, deformable object modeling, deep generative models and geometry fundamentals!
