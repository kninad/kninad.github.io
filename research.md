# Research

My current focus is on designing novel deep learning algorithms for scene
understanding and then using that for efficient grasping (as a downstream task).
The input modality can be point clouds, rgb(-d) images and I try to use other
sources of signals like object-contact manifolds to guide the learning process.
As a consequence of my effort towards making algorithms for real world settings,
I am also interested in topics like equi(or inv)-variant networks, deformable
object modeling, deep generative models and robust benchmarking for robot
manipulation.
