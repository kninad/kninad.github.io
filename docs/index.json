I took the help of pandoc to simplify the entire process. Pandoc is a very useful document converter and a handy tool for creating the html syntax of the website from a markdown file. After creating the necessary files (locally), I used Github pages for hosting the website. Primary references for design: this , this and this (although I take some liberty to break some of the commandments described in them).\nEach page of this website was written in markdown and hence it was very easy to write or modify the content and track the changes using git. The basic pandoc command for converting the markdown file to html will only output a plain html file. Although pandoc supports writing html syntax in the markdown file, its usually not recommended as its better to keep the markdown file clean.\nFor further modifications, pandoc supports passing custom html files which can be added to three positions (header, before-body and after-body) in the final html code for the page. Additionally, one can play around with the pandoc\u0026rsquo;s default html template for gaining control over the placement of certain elements (like div) in the overall code. Finally a slightly modified version of this css file was used for styling the website. It took care of making the website look a bit nice and tidy.\nTo avoid writing the long pandoc command for each file, I wrote a simple bash script to run the command on all the markdown files which made modifying the website content very convinient.\n#!/bin/bash Rootdir=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34; AUTHOR=\u0026#34;Ninad\u0026#34; CSS=\u0026#34;${Rootdir}/css/pandoc.css\u0026#34; for mf in $Rootdir/*.md do filename=\u0026#34;${mf%.*}\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Converting $mf to $filename.html\u0026#34; #Pandoc command for conversion to html:\tpandoc \\ --css \u0026#34;$CSS\u0026#34; -V author-meta=\u0026#34;$AUTHOR\u0026#34; \\ -f markdown -t html5 $mf -o $filename.html\tdone\t2023 Update (Makefiles!) The above process kind of works but it makes a strong assumption that all the files are in a single directory without any nesting. However this is not an ideal layout if we want to separate content like blog, projects etc. Additionally, it re-generates all the files without a check whether something has changed or not! To counter the above two points we can setup a simple Makefile based approach to build the website.\nThis Makefile still only process documents in the current directory but if we have such a makefile in every sub-directory taking care that each of the nested makefiles have all, clean targets, then this kind of workflow will work.\nCollect current dir markdown files SOURCES = $(wildcard *.md) Create html targets using pattern substitution: $(patsubst %.md,%.html,$(SOURCES)) Have a all target where we also go into the sub-dirs (here we only have blog) and run make on their respective all targets The actual pandoc command is quite straightforward: I have a lua filter to convert all internal markdown links to html Using a specific css file (note, path to it will change in the Makefile in sub-dirs) Add a navbar and footer The clean target also has a cd subdir \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make $@ to automate the cleaning using the sub-dir\u0026rsquo;s Makefile (remember we need to add clean in it as well). Thus we need a single command to build out the entire website: make all and a single command to clean all generated files: make clean\nSTRING1 = \u0026#34;Last updated on \u0026#34; STRING2 = \u0026#34;Created using [pandoc]\\(http://pandoc.org/\\).\u0026#34; SOURCES = $(wildcard *.md) HTMLs = $(patsubst %.md,%.html,$(SOURCES)) # See the A B website (youtube video) for sep shell scripts for blog portion TEMPFILE = sdfgsdfs7fs8d7tfgsduifgsdi5234j .PHONY : all all: $(HTMLs) echo \u0026#34;Building the blog using its Makefile\u0026#34; @cd blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make $@ %.html: %.md @cat $\u0026lt; \u0026gt; $(TEMPFILE) @echo \u0026#34;\\n \u0026lt;hr / id=\u0026#34;hr_footer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;*\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;footer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;$(STRING1) `stat -c %Y Makefile | date +\u0026#39;%b %d, %Y\u0026#39;`. $(STRING2)*\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; $(TEMPFILE) @pandoc --lua-filter=./static/links-to-html.lua -c ./static/css/pandoc.css -B navbar.html --mathjax -t html5 --standalone -i $(TEMPFILE) -o $@ @rm -f $(TEMPFILE) .PHONY : clean clean: rm -f $(HTMLs) cd blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make $@ ","date":"May 19, 2018","permalink":"/posts/pandoc_website/","summary":"I wrote this page to document the process of creating this website.

But this was just an exploration phase after I had come to know about Linux and the GNU project. In first semester in undergrad at iitk I used the computer center labs (CentOS, gnome 2) and also we had to write C programming assignments on those computers.\nMotivation In my second semester, I became more sucked into all the different DEs! After that semester I became so comfortable and used to the way of things in a linux os that I installed ubuntu on my personal laptop (dual boot) and as soon my Windows os crashed right before an end semester exam, I decided to use linux almost exclusively and henceforth only booted into windows for games (fifa/cs).\nI think once a person gets used to the environment a linux based os , it can be easily used for everyday computing tasks and I have even managed to convince my father to make the switch (ofcourse after he longer had use for ms-office)! This is especially in today\u0026rsquo;s web centric world where we use our browser most of the time.\nAnother motivation was the availability of programming tools which were present by default in any installation along with the shell. I still use the standard \u0026rsquo;noob\u0026rsquo; distro i.e ubuntu (with Mate desktop environment) as it suits my needs perfectly! Some mental notes put down:\nUseful non-default programs LaTeX editor: Texmaker Calibre: ebook management Numix theme/icons for making desktop \u0026lsquo;pretty\u0026rsquo; Tmux: terminal tabbing/windows Redshift: reduce blue intensity of screen light (during dark hours) Things to keep in mind Days of distro-hopping (same goes for DE) are over. Go with what works best and makes you productive. Preferably download os .iso file over torrent and remember to check hashes. Use the file backup utilities to prevent catastrophe!!! Suspend issue: install nvidia driver with acpi_sleep=nonvs in grub + kernel update Screen tearing: again drive + compositor like compiz helps Battery Life: Install TLP / switch off nvidia gpu Debian not added as sudo: You have to login as root and add your user as sudo. #adduser username sudo Fonts: In Debian 8, fonts did not look \u0026lsquo;pretty\u0026rsquo; by default. Fonts wiki will help. Also check anti-aliasing settings, font rendering.
