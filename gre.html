<p>This is a short guide for the GRE exam. I plan to list down some important resources that I found helpful. My approximate timeline for preparation was ~ 1 month.</p>
<hr />
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start with the free sample exam software from ets website. This will help in knowing the areas to focus on and it will also give an approximate score range to work on.</p></li>
<li><p>A physical book { or ebook/pdf if you know how to obtain them ;) } like ets book/kaplan/manhattan etc will help in revising the basics of math (if you have been away from math for a long time!). It usually includes sample essays and detailed explanations and solutions for practice problems (helpful for the verbal section questions).</p></li>
<li><p>A good alternative to the book is the free website of <a href="https://www.greenlighttestprep.com/">Greenlight test prep</a> which has video and text guides for all the three sections. Its free section is sufficient for preparation and is definitely a complete package!</p></li>
<li><p>For practice tests in addition to the the two free ones from the ets software, there are numerous free tests available online which can be accessed by registering on the websites of the major agencies who produce gre test preparation material (kaplan etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>I also found the vocab builder app by magoosh very useful for the recalling the new words in the verbal section. In the app I could only progress upto the six common word lists but nevertheless it made a major impact on my verbal score.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>I would also like to note that majority of my friends found this whole experience of gre exam and the subsequent sending of scores to be very similar to a scam due to its high (and probably unjustified) fee for additional services.</p>
<p>The fee for giving the exam already burns a hole in the pocket for students from developing countries and therefore the fee for sending the extra scores (electronically!!) should not be so high or atleast the upper limit for number of colleges to send scores should be raised to 8-10.</p>
