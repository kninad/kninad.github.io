TODO Overview
-------------

Current Look: It looks clean and almost perfect right now. So please do not 
tweak it any further and focus on adding more content rather than styling it. 

Purpose: Review websites and plan what content to add (general structure of 
the website). Fun / weird stuff can always go under Misc!

### Blog

- Setup a python script to go through all `.md` files in the `blog/` folder
  and auto-create a index that populates `blog/index.md`

- Can try to have a more advanced system with a `.json` for each blog post,
  use those json for tagging and abstract which will be displayed on the blog
  index

### Home
- Research interests: Short summary and advisor info.
- Teaching (TAed courses + mentees)
- Reviewing
- Talks
- Publications and Preprints (Can later move this to a separate page + add link to google
  scholar or related websites)
- Software: link to github repos of important codes? + short description (can be in misc too)


### Research

An entire page dedicated to short summaries of papers and high-level ideas about your researach.
Also acts as a way to organize your papers! Need not include all your pubs. Add relevant images and pdf links to papers. Also can add a wordcloud image at the beginning or end. 


### Misc

- Add stuff about hobbies: music, sketching, football (notes for them) + other thoughts under
  an appropriate section header
  
- Add technical notes under a different subsection. Make sure to add dates to all notes. Can be 
  about some good concepts / demos (encountered while surfing, homeworks etc)

- Can use the MENU file to link notes directly! (see jemdoc homepage)

- Finally, there will be a Useful Links + Footy pic section in Misc

- Can add undergrad and other side projects too!

- Can add some research projects too (CV / NLP / DL stuff under projects done)

- Add in Misc: Prime numbers, mathy stuff, linux/foss ubuntu mate stuff

- Add redshift link to Useful Links under Notes
