## Football (For rest of the world!)

My primary passtime is playing and watching football. Here are some football related 
websites that I like:

- [Fantasy premier league](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/)

- [Spielverlagerung](http://spielverlagerung.com/)


Below are some pics during a time where I ate, slept and played football. The sport has
given me many fond memories and good friends!
