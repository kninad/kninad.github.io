<!-- **About** -->

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Dallas. I work on computer vision and machine learning research problems with applications in robot perception & manipulation. I am associated with the [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/) and I am advised by [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/) and  [Dr. B Prabhakaran](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/bprabhakaran). I spent four memorable years at IIT Kanpur from where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the department of  Mathematics and Statistics. My current research work revolves around data driven robot manipulation. I am particularly interested in the problem of transferring grasps across grippers and development of robust computer vision and geometry based algorithms for grasping.


<!-- Here are some of my repos created for niche use case!

- [resume-pandoc](https://github.com/kninad/resume-pandoc) : Auto generate resume in different formats from a *single* markdown source.
- [rippledoc-ext](https://kninad.github.io/rippledoc-ext) :  Extended rippledoc to created html pages from folder full of markdown files.
- [chess-pgn-gif](https://github.com/kninad/chess-pgn-gif) : Create a gif of chess game using its pgn file. -->

Apart from work, I am actively trying to wean myself from being obssesed about playing football (requested by my knees!) Efforts towards this *goal* include cooking, writing and becoming lazy with my physical fitness.
