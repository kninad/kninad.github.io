# Guiding Principles

I wrote down some key principles to summarize many discussions with friends and family over life, spirituality and related topics. Most approaches towards "life" are not exactly taught and we need to explore and see what works  for us from the vast religious, spiritual and philosophical literature available to us. Also trying (action) these bullet points is more important than just contemplating about different approaches!


Energy maximization: Sleep better and waste less energy. Good sleep should be number one priority, since without it our mental health suffers. What works for me is saying a small prayer which my "aaji" (grandmother) taught me along with just being grateful. Taking some time out for meditation and exercise have definitely helped me!

Maintaining a positive outlook: We can't be absolutely sure of everything in life, so why not take a positive perspective whenever in doubt! I have learnt that our thought process needs active training in this regard and just our "nazariya" (perspective) can make a big difference to our mood, leading to a more joyful time. 

Enjoy moments in life: Strive to live in the present and not take unnecessary worry about things out of our hand. What works for me is finishing my obligations (without procrastination) by viewing myself from a 3rd person view i.e someone who I am responsible for! Also not having too many unrealistic expectations in general leads to much less sorrow. 

I have had a blessed life until now and it is up to me to augment it further. We don't know what might happen tomorrow, so enjoy while the journey lasts!
