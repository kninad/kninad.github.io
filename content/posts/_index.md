title: Notes
---

A miscellaneous collection of notes. I am not a blogger yet but I hope to post some interesting things under the "Today-I-Learned" (more like "today-i-wrote"!) broad theme. Of course, *interest* is subjective and someone who is already a wise person, programmer, or researcher might find such notes trivial! I want to write for my own documentation and cultivate the art of writing/communication in English. So with this warning, feel free to take a look at my notes!
