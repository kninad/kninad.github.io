LaTeX is a very useful language for writing professional looking documents and articles. I try to use it for all my assignments and letters/resume. 
It may take some time to learn (1-2 hours max) but its very useful in the long term. Most of the research papers and technical books make use of it. 

On my Ubuntu/Debian system I usually install the full texlive package since it does not take much space (relatively speaking! ~1.8 GB) and saves the hassle of installing individual packages. I pair it up with Texmaker editor which works very well for my needs. For an online solution, I found [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) to very convinient. It also has many short guides on various topics.

- The times font looks much better than the default latin-modern font!
- Best path is to go all in after reading a short tutorial and search the questions as they come up. (especially true for math mode!)
