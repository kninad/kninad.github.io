I am a first year PhD student in the 
[Computer Science](https://www.cs.utdallas.edu/)
department at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).
I spent four wonderful years in [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) 
from where I graduated with a bachelors degree in the department of mathematics and 
statistics. I am still learning what it means to be a researcher and hopefully
I can make the transition to an honest and sincere version!
I generally like to read about all topics under the sun and when I am not into 
some reading or sleeping, I like to play football and go for running or bicycling.
