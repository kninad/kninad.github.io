I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
I graduated from IIT - Kanpur in 2017  with a Bachelors degree from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
My interests are in the problems of machine learning and  probabilistic modelling and their applications in fields
of language and healthcare. I am also interested in causal inference and more explainable forms of artificial 
intelligence in general.
