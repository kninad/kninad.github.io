I am a final year masters student in computer science at the 
[University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I completed my undergraduate education from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2017  with
a bachelors degree from the department of mathematics and statistics. Hopefully 
I will be able to use my education for a good cause! 

I like to read about all topics under the sun. When I am not into some reading or sleeping, I like to play football and occasionally going for running and 
bicycling. I am trying to pick up sketching from the awesome resource of 
[drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) along with developing a taste for all types
of music (learning to play a basic instrument helps a lot in this regard).
