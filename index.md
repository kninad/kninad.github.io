I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas
at Dallas. I work on computer vision and machine learning
research problems with applications in robot perception & manipulation. I am 
associated with the 
[Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/) and I am
advised by [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/) and 
[Dr. B Prabhakaran](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/bprabhakaran).
I spent four memorable years at IIT Kanpur from where I graduated with a 
bachelors degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the department of 
Mathematics and Statistics.

My current research work revolves around data driven robot manipulation.
I am particularly interested in the problem of transferring grasps across grippers and development of robust computer vision/3d geometry based algorithms for synthesizing grasps.


## (Fun?) Stuff

Here are some of my open source repos created for some niche use cases!

- [rippledoc-ext](https://kninad.github.io/rippledoc-ext) :  Extended rippledoc to created html pages from folder full of markdown files.
- [chess-pgn-gif](https://github.com/kninad/chess-pgn-gif) : Create a gif of chess game using its pgn file.
