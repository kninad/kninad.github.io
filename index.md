I am a final year masters student in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
I completed my undergraduate education from [IIT-Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2017  with a 
bachelors degree from the department of mathematics and statistics.
My research interests lie in the problems of machine learning and  probabilistic modelling and their 
applications in fields of language and healthcare. I am also interested in causal inference and 
explainable forms of artificial intelligence in general.

When I am not into some reading or sleeping, I like to play football 
and occasionally going for running and bicycling. I am also trying to pick up sketching from
the awesome resource of [drawabox](https://drawabox.com/).
