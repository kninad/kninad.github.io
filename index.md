I am a first year PhD student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utdallas.edu/)
department at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).
I completed my undergraduate education from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) 
in 2017  with a bachelors degree from the department of mathematics and statistics.
Hopefully I will be able to use my education for a good cause! 
I generally like to read about all topics under the sun and when I am not into 
some reading or sleeping, I like to play football and go for running or bicycling. 
I am trying to pick up sketching boxes from the awesome resource of 
[drawabox](https://drawabox.com/).
