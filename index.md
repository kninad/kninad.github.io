I am a final year masters student in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
I graduated from IIT-Kanpur in 2017  with a bachelors degree from the department of mathematics and statistics.
My research interests lie in the problems of machine learning and  probabilistic modelling and their applications in fields
of language and healthcare. I am also interested in causal inference and explainable forms of artificial 
intelligence in general.

When I am not into some reading or sleeping, I like to play football 
(soccer) and occasionally going on running/bicycling sessions. In order to 
be more "artistic" I am also trying to pick up sketching from
the awesome website of [drawabox](https://drawabox.com/).
